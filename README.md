## Overview

vJailbreak is a powerful migration tool designed to seamlessly transfer virtual machines from VMware environments to any OpenStack-compliant cloud platform. The project aims to simplify the complex process of VM migration while ensuring compatibility and performance in the target environment.

### Key Features

- **VMware Integration**: Connect directly to vCenter to access and discover source VMs

- **Automated VM Conversion**: Convert VM disks from `vmdk` to `qcow2` format and prepare for OpenStack environment

- **OpenStack Integration**: Direct deployment to any OpenStack-compliant cloud with network and storage mapping

- **Flexible Migration Options**: Support for both hot and cold migrations with customizable scheduling

- **Rolling Conversion**: Staged migration process that minimizes downtime and resource usage

- **Advanced Migration Options**: Customizable migration parameters including network configuration, resource allocation, and storage mappings

- **Health Verification**: Post-migration health checks to ensure successful migration

- **Scalable Architecture**: Scale up or down migration agents based on workload

- **Enhanced Security**: Secure handling of credentials and data throughout the migration process

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **VMware Environment**:
  - VMware vCenter with appropriate permissions
  - vSphere environment accessible to vJailbreak

- **OpenStack Environment**:
  - OpenStack-compliant cloud target
  - Network and storage access

- **Network Connectivity**:
  - Access to vCenter, ESXi, and OpenStack API endpoints
  - Access to download virtio drivers and other components
  - ICMP (ping) access for connectivity verification

- **Supported OS**:
  - All operating systems supported by virt-v2v
  - See [virt-v2v support page](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) for details

> **Note:** For an extensive and detailed list of all prerequisites, including network ports, access requirements, and FAQ, please refer to the [Prerequisites documentation](https://platform9.github.io/vjailbreak/introduction/prerequisites/).

### Quick Start

1. **Install ORAS and download vJailbreak**:
   ```bash
   # Install ORAS (see https://oras.land/docs/installation)
   
   # Download the latest vJailbreak image
   oras pull quay.io/platform9/vjailbreak:<tag>
   # This downloads the image to vjailbreak_qcow2/vjailbreak-image.qcow2
   ```

2. **Upload image and create vJailbreak VM**:
   ```bash
   # Upload the image to your OpenStack environment
   openstack image create --os-interface admin --insecure \
     --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 \
     --file vjailbreak_qcow2/vjailbreak-image.qcow2 vjailbreak-image
   
   # Deploy a VM from this image (use UI or CLI)
   # - Choose m1.xlarge flavor (or larger for large VM migrations)
   # - Select a network that can reach your VMware vCenter
   # - Configure security group to allow required traffic
   ```

3. **Copy VDDK Libraries**:
   - Download [VDDK libraries](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/)
   - Copy to `/home/ubuntu` on the vJailbreak VM
   - Untar to create `vmware-vix-disklib-distrib` in `/home/ubuntu`

4. **Launch vJailbreak**:
   - Connect to the vJailbreak UI using the VM's IP address
   - Provide VMware vCenter and OpenStack credentials
   - Begin migrating VMs
