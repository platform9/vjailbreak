## vJailbreak at Scale: Managing Agents with VjailbreakNode

vJailbreak can be scaled to perform multiple migrations in parallel by deploying additional `agents`, enabling greater efficiency and workload distribution. The VjailbreakNode Custom Resource Definition (CRD) streamlines the creation and management of these agents, ensuring seamless integration into the migration workflow. Each `VjailbreakNode` represents a VM that functions as an independent migration `agent`. These agents are dynamically added to the original `VjailbreakNode`, forming a cohesive cluster that enhances scalability, reliability, and overall migration performance.

### VjailbreakNode CRD

The `VjailbreakNode` CRD allows you to manage vJailbreak nodes within your Kubernetes cluster. Here's how to define a `VjailbreakNode` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: vjailbreak.k8s.pf9.io/v1alpha1
kind: VjailbreakNode
metadata:
  name: example-vjailbreak-node
  namespace: migration-system
spec:
  imageid: "your-openstack-image-id" # This ID is for the first vjailbreak VMimage. It auto-populates in the UIâ€”do not delete it. 
  noderole: "migration-worker"
  openstackcreds:
    name: "sapmo1" # Reference to your OpenstackCreds
    namespace: "migration-system"
  openstackflavorid: "your-openstack-flavor-id"
 ```
 
 ## Explanation of VjailbreakNode CRD Fields  

This `VjailbreakNode` CRD defines a Kubernetes resource that provisions a VM in OpenStack to act as a migration agent. Below is a breakdown of each field:  


### Metadata  
- **`metadata:`**  
  Metadata contains identifying details about the `VjailbreakNode`.  
  - **`name: example-vjailbreak-node`**  
    Specifies the name of this `VjailbreakNode` resource in Kubernetes.  
  - **`namespace: migration-system`**  
    Indicates the namespace where this resource is deployed within the Kubernetes cluster.  

### Spec (Specification)  
The `spec` section defines the desired state of the `VjailbreakNode`.  

- **`imageid: "your-openstack-image-id"`**  
  - This is the ID of the OpenStack image used to create the VM.  
  - **It must match the image ID used to create the initial vJailbreak VM**, ensuring compatibility across all migration agents.  

- **`noderole: "worker"`**  
  - Defines the role of the node.  
  - It should be set to `"worker"` as this node functions as a migration agent within the vJailbreak cluster.  

- **`openstackcreds:`**  
  - OpenstackCreds use the variables from the openstack.rc file.
  - **`name: "sapmo1"`** â†’ Refers to a `Secret` or `CustomResource` storing OpenStack authentication details.  
  - **`namespace: "migration-system"`** â†’ The namespace where OpenStack credentials are stored.  

- **`openstackflavorid: "your-openstack-flavor-id"`**  
  - Specifies the OpenStack flavor ID, which determines the VM's compute resources (CPU, RAM, disk size, etc.).  
  - The chosen flavor should align with the resource requirements for migration workloads.  

This configuration ensures vJailbreak can scale efficiently by adding worker nodes dynamically to handle multiple migrations in parallel. ðŸš€  

ðŸš¨ ** Important note ** ðŸš¨
After scaling up make sure that Copy over the [VDDK libraries](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/8.0) for Linux into `/home/ubuntu` of the new agents. Untar it to a folder name `vmware-vix-disklib-distrib` in `/home/ubuntu` directory. 

**_NOTE:_**
To retrieve the password for logging into a worker node, follow these steps:
1. SSH into the master node and run:
   ```bash
   cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
2. The first 12 characters of this token is your password.
