### Network and access requirements
Ensure that your vJailbreak VM can communicate with your OpenStack and VMware environments. This includes any setup required for VPNs, etc.

<ReadMore>Further details can be found in [Prerequisites](../prerequisites/).</ReadMore>

### Install ORAS and download vJailbreak

Download and install [ORAS](https://oras.land/docs/installation). Then, download the latest version of the vJailbreak image with the following command:
  ```shell
  oras pull quay.io/platform9/vjailbreak:v0.1.7
  ```
This will download the vJailbreak qcow2 folder containing the image locally in the current directory named `vjailbreak_qcow2/vjailbreak-image.qcow2`.

### Upload image and create vJailbreak VM 
:::note
These example instructions are for any version of [Private Cloud Director](https://platform9.com/private-cloud-director/) - Platform9 hosted, self-hosted, or [Community Edition](https://platform9.com/docs/private-cloud-director/private-cloud-director/getting-started-with-community-edition) - but can be adapted for any OpenStack-compliant cloud.
:::
- Follow the instructions in _Private Cloud Director > Images > Import with CLI_ to upload the image from the command line.
- Upload `vjailbreak-image.qcow2` to your image library.
  ```shell
  openstack image create --os-interface admin --insecure --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 --file vjailbreak-image.qcow2 vjailbreak-image.qcow2
  ```
- Deploy a new VM from image, choosing the _m1.xlarge_ flavor.
- Choose a network that can reach your VMware vCenter environment.
- Give the VM a name, optionally assign an SSH key, and set a password using cloud-init.
- Assign a network security group that allows inbound and outbound traffic.

### Copy VDDK Libraries
- Copy the latest version of the [VDDK libraries](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/8.0) for Linux into `/home/ubuntu` of the vjailbreak VM. Untar it to a folder named `vmware-vix-disklib-distrib` in the `/home/ubuntu` directory.

### Launch vJailbreak
- Connect to the vJailbreak UI using the IP address assigned during VM creation.
- Start the migration process by providing the VMware vCenter and OpenStack admin.rc credentials.
- Select the VMs you wish to migrate and complete the rest of the migration form.
- Migrate your VMs.
