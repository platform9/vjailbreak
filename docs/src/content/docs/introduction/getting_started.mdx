vJailbreak works by running itself as a VM on the target OpenStack cloud. It connects remotely
to the VMware vSphere environment to perform the migration. vJailbreak uses the VMware VDDK
library to interact with the VMware environment and perform the necessary disk copy operations.

It also uses the OpenStack SDK to interact with the OpenStack environment and perform the necessary
provisioning operations including creation of volumes, VMs.

### Network and access requirements
Ensure that your vJailbreak VM can communicate with your OpenStack and VMware environments. This includes any setup required for VPNs, etc.

<ReadMore>Further details can be found in [Prerequisites](../prerequisites/).</ReadMore>

### Install ORAS and download vJailbreak

Download and install [ORAS](https://oras.land/docs/installation), a toolkit to download the qcow2 image of vJailbreak. Then, download the latest version of the vJailbreak image with the following command:
  ```shell
  # remember the actual version would vary
  oras pull quay.io/platform9/vjailbreak:v0.2.1
  ```
This will download the vJailbreak qcow2 folder containing the image locally in the current directory named `vjailbreak_qcow2/vjailbreak-image.qcow2`.

### Upload image to OpenStack
:::note
These example instructions are for any version of [Private Cloud Director](https://platform9.com/private-cloud-director/) - Platform9 hosted, self-hosted, or [Community Edition](https://platform9.com/docs/private-cloud-director/private-cloud-director/getting-started-with-community-edition) - but can be adapted for any OpenStack-compliant cloud.
:::
- Follow the instructions in _Private Cloud Director > Images > Import with CLI_ to upload the image from the command line.
- Upload `vjailbreak-image.qcow2` to your image library.
  ```shell
  openstack image create --os-interface admin --insecure --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 --file vjailbreak-image.qcow2 vjailbreak-image.qcow2
  ```

### Create vJailbreak VM
- Deploy a new VM from the uploaded image, choosing the _m1.xlarge_ flavor (use larger flavor for larger VM migration).
- Choose a network that can reach your VMware vCenter environment.
- Assign a network security group that allows inbound and outbound traffic.

### Configure VM with cloud-init
:::note
Cloud-init can be used during VM creation to automate initial configuration including setting passwords and configuring /etc/hosts entries for DNS resolution.
:::
- When creating the VM, use a cloud-init configuration script to:
  - Set a password for the ubuntu user
  - Add static DNS entries to /etc/hosts

  ```yaml
  #cloud-config
  password: your-secure-password
  chpasswd: { expire: False }
  ssh_pwauth: True
  
  write_files:
  - path: /etc/hosts.append
    append: true
    content: |
      # VMware and OpenStack endpoints
      192.168.1.100 vcenter.example.com
      192.168.2.100 openstack.example.com
  
  runcmd:
    - cat /etc/hosts.append >> /etc/hosts
  ```
- You can provide this cloud-init configuration when creating the VM through the OpenStack dashboard or CLI.

### Copy VDDK Libraries
:::note
VMware VDDK library is required for vJailbreak to interact with the VMware environment and it must be configured in the vJailbreak VM.
:::
- Copy the latest version of the [VDDK libraries](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/8.0) for Linux into `/home/ubuntu` of the vJailbreak VM. Untar it to a folder named `vmware-vix-disklib-distrib` in the `/home/ubuntu` directory.

### Configure DNS Resolution
:::note
Proper DNS resolution for your VMware and OpenStack URLs is required for vJailbreak to function correctly. You can either configure this during VM creation with cloud-init (as shown above) or modify the configuration after VM deployment.
:::

- **Static Entries**: If you didn't configure `/etc/hosts` entries during VM creation with cloud-init, you can add them manually. Changes to `/etc/hosts` apply immediately.
  ```shell
  # Example manual addition to /etc/hosts
  sudo sh -c 'echo "192.168.1.100 vcenter.example.com" >> /etc/hosts'
  sudo sh -c 'echo "192.168.2.100 openstack.example.com" >> /etc/hosts'
  ```

- **DNS Configuration**: If modifying `/etc/resolv.conf` to use DNS servers instead of static entries, you must restart the controller pod for changes to take effect
  ```shell
  # After modifying resolv.conf
  kubectl -n vjailbreak rollout restart deployment migration-controller-manager
  ```

### Launch vJailbreak
- Connect to the vJailbreak UI using the IP address assigned during VM creation.
- Start the migration process by providing the VMware vCenter and OpenStack admin.rc credentials.
- Select the VMs you wish to migrate and complete the rest of the migration form.
- Migrate your VMs.
