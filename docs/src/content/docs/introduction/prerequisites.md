---

### Are IPs and MAC addresses persisted?
Yes, if your OpenStack network has a valid subnet range that allows the IP to be allocated, vJailbreak will create a port with the same MAC address and IP address as the source VM.

### What OS versions are supported?
We internally use virt-v2v, so all operating systems supported for conversion by virt-v2v are supported by vJailbreak. You can find a detailed list of them [here](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html#guests).

### Do I need to perform any manual steps to remove VMware Tools?
No, vJailbreak will remove them for you, with the help of virt-v2v. The process that virt-v2v uses along with alternative approaches can be found [here](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v.1.html#converting-a-windows-guest).

### Do I need to perform any manual steps to install drivers for Linux and Windows VMs?
No, vJailbreak will install it for you. For Windows, we allow you to specify a URL for a specific version of virtio drivers. This is useful for older Windows versions, eg. Windows Server 2012, which specifically need [v0.1.189](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/virtio-win-0.1.189-1/virtio-win-0.1.189.iso) in order to work.

| `Virtual machine.Snapshot management.Remove Snapshot` | Allows removal of a snapshot from the snapshot history. |
| `Datastore` privileges: |     |
| `Datastore.Browse datastore` | Allows exploring the contents of a datastore. |
| `Datastore.Low level file operations` | Allows performing low-level file operations - read, write, delete, and rename - in a datastore. |

### What ports do I need to open for vJailbreak to work?
Please refer the following table for the required ports:

| Port | Protocol | Source | Destination | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 443 | TCP | PCD nodes | VMware vCenter API endpiont | VMware provider inventory<br><br>Disk transfer authentication |
| 443 | TCP | PCD nodes | VMware ESXi hosts | Disk transfer authentication |
| 902 | TCP | PCD nodes | VMware ESXi hosts | Disk transfer data copy |
| 5480 | TCP | PCD nodes | VMware vCenter API endpoint | VMware Site Recovery Manager Appliance Management Interface |


### What network connectivity do I need for vJailbreak?

<!-- The vJailbreak VM and any helper nodes must be able to resolve & connect to your VMware vCenter environment and all ESXi hosts, and must be able to resolve & connect to [quay.io](https://quay.io). -->

The vJailbreak VM and any helper nodes must be able to resolve and connect to the following:

- **vCenter, ESXi, and OpenStack API endpoints** — required for API communication.
- **Cloud-init certificate endpoints**:
- [`https://<FQDN>:443`](https://<FQDN>) — the FQDN is typically the hostname or IP of the VM where vJailbreak is deployed, used to retrieve certificates during cloud-init.
- **Virtio ISO download source**:
  - [https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso)
- **Health-check endpoints on migrated guest VMs** — over user-defined HTTP/HTTPS ports.
- **External tooling sources**:
  - [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml)
  - [https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml)
- **K3s installation sources** — includes scripts and supporting binaries fetched from:
  - [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io)
  - [https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s)
  - [https://update.k3s.io](https://update.k3s.io)
  - [https://github.com/rancher/k3s-root](https://github.com/rancher/k3s-root)
- **Helm chart repository for NGINX ingress** — used during setup:
  - [https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx)
- **Container registries required to pull images** — needed for K3s, vJailbreak components (controller, UI), Prometheus, Grafana, CoreDNS, NGINX ingress, exporters, etc.:
  - [https://docker.io](https://docker.io)
  - [https://ghcr.io](https://ghcr.io)
  - [https://quay.io](https://quay.io)
  - [https://registry.k8s.io](https://registry.k8s.io)
- **ICMP (ping) access to guest VM IPs** — for connectivity verification
