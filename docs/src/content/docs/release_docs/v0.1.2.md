## Known Issues
* If the VM to be migrated has an LV spanning multiple physical devices used as boot volume unless both are mounted simultaneously to the OS-VM, vJailbreak cannot detect whether it is bootable, or not. ([issue link](https://github.com/platform9/vjailbreak/issues/146))
* If a user turns on a VM on VCenter after migration and tries to migrate it again, the migration object will not be created. In this case, the user should delete the VM from PCD/Openstack before trying the migration again. This error will be pushed up the stack for visibility.
