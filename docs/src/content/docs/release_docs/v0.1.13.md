### Usability Enhancements and Stability Improvements

- **Rolling Conversion (Beta Availability)**  
  The Rolling Conversion feature is now available as a beta release.

- **Pre-Packaged vJailbreak Image**  
  A new vJailbreak image is now available, containing all required components pre-installed. This enhancement eliminates the need for internet access during installation, making it suitable for restricted network environments.

- **Support for Custom VirtIO Drivers**  
  Users may now upload VirtIO drivers to a designated path. If present, these drivers will be utilized during the migration process. If absent, the system will default to downloading the necessary drivers from the internet, providing flexibility based on deployment conditions. https://github.com/platform9/vjailbreak/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/guides/virtio_doc.md

- **Resolution of Pod Eviction Due to Disk Pressure**  
  An issue causing pod eviction under disk pressure conditions has been resolved. This fix improves the reliability and stability of workloads during extended migration operations.

- **Enhanced Debug Logging**  
  Debug logs have been improved to provide more comprehensive and structured output
