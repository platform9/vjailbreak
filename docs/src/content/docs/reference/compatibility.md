description: A list of supported VMware and operating system versions.
---

Following is a list of systems vJailbreak has been validated with. Please reach out to us to report any issues or to add support for additional versions.

## VMware

* VMware vCenter Server 6.7
* VMware vCenter Server 7.0
* VMware vCenter Server 8.0

## Operating System

The list of operating system is large and while we have attempted
to test some of them, there are still gaps specifically with the older
versions. This list is expected to grow over time and we will continue to
add support for additional versions. Verified implies it has been tested and converted vs expected means it has not been tested but is expected to work.
