## How vJailbreak Works

vJailbreak's intuitive interface leverages the OpenStack SDK to interact directly with both your VMware vSphere environment and your target OpenStack cloud. The UI guides you through these key steps:

1.  **Connection Setup:** Easily configure connections to your source VMware vSphere environment and your target OpenStack cloud.
2.  **VM Selection:** Select the VMs you wish to migrate from your vSphere environment.
3.  **Migration Planning:** Configure migration settings, such as target storage and network configurations, through interactive forms.
4.  **Migration Execution:** Initiate and monitor the migration process with real-time progress updates.
5.  **Post-Migration Validation:** Verify the successful migration and launch of your VMs in OpenStack.
