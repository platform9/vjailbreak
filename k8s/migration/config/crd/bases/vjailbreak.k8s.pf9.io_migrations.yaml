          Migration is the Schema for the migrations API that represents a single virtual machine
          migration job from VMware to OpenStack. It tracks the complete migration lifecycle
          including validation, data transfer, disk conversion, and cutover phases. Migration resources
          provide detailed status monitoring, error handling, and manual intervention points like
          cutover initiation. Each Migration is associated with a MigrationPlan and executes on a specific
          VjailbreakNode agent, tracking progress via status updates and condition changes.
