          VMwareMachine is the Schema for the vmwaremachines API that represents a virtual machine
          in the VMware source environment targeted for migration. It tracks VM configuration,
          resource allocation, migration status, and target environment specifications.
          VMwareMachine resources are the primary workloads migrated from VMware to OpenStack
          as part of the migration process and contain all necessary information to recreate
          equivalent virtual machines in the target environment.
