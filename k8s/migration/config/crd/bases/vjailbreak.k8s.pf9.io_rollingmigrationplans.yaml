          RollingMigrationPlan is the Schema for the rollingmigrationplans API that defines a coordinated
          migration of multiple VMware clusters and ESXi hosts to Platform9 Distributed Cloud (PCD).
          It supports sequenced migration of VMs across clusters with configurable batch sizes,
          cluster-to-cluster mapping, and tracking of migration progress across the entire datacenter migration.
