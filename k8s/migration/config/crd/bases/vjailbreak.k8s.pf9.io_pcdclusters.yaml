          PCDCluster is the Schema for the pcdclusters API that represents a Platform9 Distributed Cloud
          cluster in the migration system. It defines cluster configuration including host membership,
          high availability settings, and resource rebalancing policies. PCDCluster resources track both
          the desired state of clusters as part of migration planning and the observed state of actual
          PCD clusters in the target environment. They serve as destination targets for VM migrations
          from VMware ESXi environments.
