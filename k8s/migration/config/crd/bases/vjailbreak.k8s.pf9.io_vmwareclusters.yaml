          VMwareCluster is the Schema for the vmwareclusters API that represents a VMware vSphere cluster
          in the source environment. It tracks cluster configuration, member hosts, and migration status
          as part of the VMware to Platform9 Distributed Cloud migration process. VMwareCluster resources
          serve as source components that are migrated to corresponding PCDCluster resources in the target environment.
