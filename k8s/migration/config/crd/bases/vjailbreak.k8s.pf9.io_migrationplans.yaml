          MigrationPlan is the Schema for the migrationplans API that defines
          how to migrate virtual machines from VMware to OpenStack including migration strategy and scheduling.
          It allows administrators to configure migration parameters such as timing, health checks,
          and VM-specific settings for bulk VM migration operations between environments.
