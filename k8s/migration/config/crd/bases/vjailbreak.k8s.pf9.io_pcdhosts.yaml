          PCDHost is the Schema for the pcdhosts API that represents a physical or virtual host
          in a Platform9 Distributed Cloud environment. It tracks the host's configuration,
          network interfaces, assigned roles, and operational status. PCDHost resources are created
          as part of the migration process when converting ESXi hosts to PCD hosts or when provisioning
          new infrastructure to replace migrated VMware hosts.
