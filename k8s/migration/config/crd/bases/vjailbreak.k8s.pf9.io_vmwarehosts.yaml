          VMwareHost is the Schema for the vmwarehosts API that represents a VMware ESXi host
          in the source environment. It tracks host configuration, hardware identification, and cluster membership
          as part of the VMware to Platform9 Distributed Cloud migration process. VMwareHost resources are
          source components that are migrated to PCDHost resources in the target environment and are automatically
          removed from vCenter inventory after all VMs have been migrated off and the host is in maintenance mode.
